# Problem Statement

## Improve efficiency of Reconciliation

Messages communicated between 2 or more IT applications are getting corrupted or lost, causing variance in the data maintained by these applications.Due to lost messages or errors, the data between these applications is not consistent, resulting in manual reconciliation efforts. Currently, Message Queue is used to communicate data.

# Solution
Blockchain can be used to tackle with this problem. 
The data in Blockchain is consistent due to consensus.So, it will maintain its Integrity and Authenticity. 
Consensus is a process of agreeing on one result among a group of participants to guarantee data consistency.
